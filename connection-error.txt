I see the error ðŸ‘‡

```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mysql'
```

Even though you installed `mysql-connector-python`, Python still canâ€™t find it. This usually happens due to one of these reasons:

---

### âœ… Possible Causes & Fixes

1. **Different Python Versions (pip vs py)**

   * You might have installed the connector with one Python version, but running the script with another.
   * Check which pip installed it:

     ```bash
     pip show mysql-connector-python
     ```
   * Or for the specific Python version:

     ```bash
     py -m pip show mysql-connector-python
     ```
   * If not found, install with:

     ```bash
     py -m pip install mysql-connector-python
     ```

2. **You Installed `mysql-connector` Instead of `mysql-connector-python`**

   * `mysql-connector` (without `-python`) is **not maintained** and often causes conflicts.
   * Uninstall both first:

     ```bash
     pip uninstall mysql-connector mysql-connector-python -y
     ```
   * Then reinstall the correct one:

     ```bash
     py -m pip install mysql-connector-python
     ```

3. **Virtual Environment Issue**

   * If youâ€™re inside a venv, the package must be installed inside it.
   * Run:

     ```bash
     py -m pip list
     ```

     and check if `mysql-connector-python` shows up.

4. **Check the Import**

   * Your code should have:

     ```python
     import mysql.connector
     ```
   * Not `import mysql` or `import MySQLdb` (thatâ€™s a different library).

ðŸ‘‰ Quick test: After installing correctly, run in terminal:

```bash
py -c "import mysql.connector; print('Connector OK')"
```

If it prints `Connector OK`, youâ€™re good. ðŸš€

Do you want me to give you the **exact installation command** that matches the Python version youâ€™re using for `db1.py`?
